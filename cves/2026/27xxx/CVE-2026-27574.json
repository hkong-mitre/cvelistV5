In versions 9.5.13 and below, custom JavaScript monitor feature uses Node.js's node:vm module (explicitly documented as not a security mechanism) to execute user-supplied code, allowing trivial sandbox escape via a well-known one-liner that grants full access to the underlying process. Because the probe runs with host networking and holds all cluster credentials (ONEUPTIME_SECRET, DATABASE_PASSWORD, REDIS_PASSWORD, CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD) in its environment variables, and monitor creation is available to the lowest role (ProjectMember) with open registration enabled by default, any anonymous user can achieve full cluster compromise in about 30 seconds. This issue has been fixed in version 10.0.5."
