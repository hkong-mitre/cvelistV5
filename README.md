This repository is a JSON 5.0 view of the official CVE List. It is a work in progress.

Until CVE Services "Hard Deploy" (targeted for 1st QT, 2023) is completed, the official published CVE List can be found at the following locations.

1. https://cve.org/Downloads: This location contains the traditional downloadable CVE list that is available in the following formats: csv, html, tzt, xml.

2. https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist (JSON 4.0): The github submission pilot will continue to be maintained during the course of the JSON 4.0 --> JSON 5.0 transition. The format is JSON 4.0 ( but it will include downconverted JSON 5.0 records)

3. https://www.cve.org (JSON 5.0) : (CVE ID retrieval pane at the top of the page): This view provides a rendering of individual records in JSON 5.0 format (and will include all JSON 4.0 records that have been upconverted to JSON 5.0).
